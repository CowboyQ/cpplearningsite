## CowboyQ's Learning Playground

This website was created as a part of my Engineer Project.
It makes use of the default Next.js app; I modified the logic behind it and now it serves as a site with a C++ course.
All the lessons were written by yours truly.

To get it going locally, you need:

[Emotion react / styled](https://emotion.sh/docs/@emotion/styled)

[Mui lab / material](https://mui.com/components/about-the-lab/)

[Gray-matter](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gray-matter)

[markdown-to-jsx](https://www.npmjs.com/package/markdown-to-jsx)

[rehype-raw](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rehype-raw)

[rehype-stringify](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rehype-stringify)

[remark-rehype](https://www.npmjs.com/package/remark-rehype)

As for license, this project was created under MIT License and should be distributed under such.
I hope this project helps someone who may one day need it.
If you have any questions, please contat me.

Below I leave the initial Readme from Next.js, maybe it'll serve you some purpose.

And yes, I know that the CSS *really* needs a rework.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
